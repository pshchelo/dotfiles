Collection of settings and scripts
##################################

Here are my settings for various Linux tools, plus some scripts and
precompiled binaries. Used mostly to keep my dev environment synced between
different machines, and to bootstrap a new development env (like new DevStak VM).

Most things are tailored to support
my favorite dark `Solarized color scheme <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>`_
and `Powerline <https://github.com/powerline/powerline>`_.
